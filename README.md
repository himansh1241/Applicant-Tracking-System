# Applicant-Tracking-System
An end-to-end resume screening &amp; optimization tool built using NLP and Machine Learning. Upload a resume, paste a job description, and instantly see how well they match — no guesswork, just data.  This project simulates how ATS (Applicant Tracking Systems) work under the hood and helps job-seekers improve their resumes before applying.
